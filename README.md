<h2>Description</h2>
This Python script simulates a simple dice game where the player rolls a dice and accumulates points based on the result. The game continues until the player either chooses to stop or rolls a "1", which causes them to lose and end the game. Each roll of the dice adds the result to the player's score. If the player rolls a "1", they lose, and the game ends with a message displaying their final score. The player can choose whether to continue the game after each roll by inputting "yes" or "no".
